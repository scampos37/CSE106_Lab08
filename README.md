# CSE106_LAB08: School Grading Website
  
This program is a website that was created during our CSE106:Exploratory Computing/Fullstack. It is a simple school grading
webstie that has student and teacher accounts, class enrollment and dropping by the students, and the ability to reflect grade
changes made by the teacher on the student's account. Upon running the app.py file, the program will begin with a login screen.

names of the students enrolled in the class and their current grade next to it. The can then edit the grade and it will show up
in the student accounts.
